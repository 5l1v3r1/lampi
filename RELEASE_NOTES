                       Release notes for LA-MPI

                       
========================= Minor Release 1.0 =========================

Version 1.0.0

First release of LA-MPI, a portable, end-to-end,
network-fault-tolerant implementation of the MPI 1.2 standard (with
some extensions).

This version complies with the MPI 1.2 standard with the following
caveats:

- MPI_Cancel() is currently implemented as a no-op.  This is not
  fully consistent with the MPI standard.


Version 1.0.1

- Updated tagging of stdout/stderr. Now optional using "mpirun -t"
- Numerous improvements to argument handling for RMS startup.
- Updated man page.


Version 1.0.1

- More improvements to RMS startup.


========================= Minor Release 1.1 =========================

Version 1.1.1

- Early send completion for Quadrics


Version 1.1.2

- Incorporating ROMIO 1.2.4.1 into library for MPI-IO support.


Version 1.1.3

- Inter-host barrier now uses synchronous sends.


Version 1.1.4

- Optional CRC functionality added.
- BPROC scheduling updated.
- Licenses updated.


Version 1.1.5

- mpirun command line updated for runtime selection of checksum/CRC
  and acking behaviour.
- Documentation updated for new mpirun options.
- Quadrics fragment sizes increased for large messages.


Version 1.1.6

- Bug fix for running with different executables on each host.
- Bug fix to allow for long hostnames.


Version 1.1.7

- Bug fixes for hybrid allgatherv, gatherv and scatterv algorithms.
- The BPROC job scheduler now integrated into the spawning mechanism.


Version 1.1.8

- Build system changed to allow for explicit rpath in libmpi.so
- Fixes for more robust handling of stdin/stderr in.
- Bug fix for broadcast of large buffers.
- Bug fix to allow for more than 128 hosts.
- Application now runs reliably beyond MPI_Finalize()
- UDP optimizations.
- Added support for Mac OS X version 10.2.x.  The Mac version does
  require the Unix utility 'lndir'.  This program is part of the
  freely available X11 distribution.  X11 is available from Apple at
  http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11 or at http://www.xfree86.org/.
- The Mac version does not support the #pragma weak directive, so for
  this release, we are renaming all PMPI_* functions to MPI_*.
  
This version has been tested on ~1000 node (~4000 processor) 
Compaq Alpha ES45 / Quadrics elan 3 system.


Version 1.1.9

- Datatype initialization reorganized.  Fortran datatypes (MPI_REAL,
  etc.) are now associated with C-linkage symbols to cater for legacy
  codes written to MPICH rather than MPI standard.
- Fortran to C handle conversion is now faster.


Version 1.1.10

- Improvements in thread-safety for the UDP path.


Version 1.1.11

- Fixed out-of-order receive problem induced by mixed wild- and
  specific-source receives.
- Changes to Quadrics rail processing.


Version 1.1.12

- Optimizations for Quadrics elan3/elite3 networks.  In particular,
  remote memory buffers management on multi-rail systems is now
  handled better allowing for higher and more consistent bandwidth
  utilization.
- Support for system-wide configuration file allowing better control
  of default behavior (especially on large systems with unusual
  configurations.


========================= Minor Release 1.2 =========================

Version 1.2.0

- Myrinet GM Port.
- Extensive reorganization of source directory structure and naming.
- Some more thread-safety problems addressed.


Version 1.2.1

- Fixing a couple of UDP bugs
- Correcting parsing of configuration files

========================= Minor Release 1.3 =========================

Version 1.3.0

- Reorganized shared memory path
- Simplified model for send/recv descriptors and requests
- Reworked buffered and persisitent send logic
- Data types are now statically allocated (but not initialized) so
  that they can be referenced before MPI_Init()
- Behavior of basic but non-primitive data types wrt MPI_Get_elements()
  modified
- MPI-IO fortran bindings improved
- Build system now based on autoconf

Version 1.3.1

- Primarily an administrative release to coincide with release as a
  module on LANL ICN machines.
- Fixed bug with persistent buffered sends.
- Faster exit on early error under RMS.

Version 1.3.2

- Changed mpirun so that if RMS or BJS are present then LSF is not.
  Consulting competing schedulers only leads to tears and confusion.
- ROMIO configuration was not working properly on Tru64 systems, and
  also was defaulting to NFS.  Now we enable and try UFS support.
- Always give Totalview a list of hostnames, not host IP addresses.
  This works around problems starting tvdsvr in bulk mode.

Version 1.3.3

- Reworked datatype freeing. The decision to free resources is now
  based upon a reference count model rather than the simple check for
  pending messages.
- Minor fixes for BJS and ROMIO.
- Some code rationalization.


Version 1.3.4

- Minor fixes for resource cleanup at finalize.
- Support for newer BPROC releases.

Version 1.3.5

- More cleanup at finalize fixes, particulary in the fortran layer.
- Removed memory leak associated with datatypes.
- Fortran layer can be disabled by setting environment variable LAMPI_FORTRAN=0
- Locking in the MPI layer simplified introduction of a few macros.
- Fixes for the ever-evolving BPROC release.

Version 1.3.6

- udp bug fixes 

Version 1.3.7

- GM 2.0 support
- Send completion bug fixes

========================= Minor Release 1.4 =========================

Version 1.4.0

- ROMIO 1.2.5.1 added
- ROMIO file system specification support
- CYGWIN support
- New TCP/IP network path
- New Infiniband VAPI network path. Currently supports one-process per
  node (more processes may hang on exit).

Version 1.4.1

- Bug fix release.

Version 1.4.2

- Release for lightning.

Version 1.4.3

- Fixed problem with synchronous send completion.
- Changed configure to disable all network paths by default.

Version 1.4.4

- Fixed resource leak with persistent sends.

Version 1.4.5

- Modified TCP path to stop TCP stack from trying to coalesce data.
  This was lead to erratic performance in certain situations.

Version 1.4.6

- Various resource exhaustion and reliability fixes.

Version 1.4.7

- Panasas file system support

Version 1.4.8

- Support for new Quadrics QSNET libraries (elanctrl)

  time out.

- More Panasas file system support.

- AMD Opteron in 64-bit mode port verified.

- Fixes for Quadrics hardware broadcast optimizations.

Version 1.4.10

- Added generic --enable-large-file-support option, rather than
  coupling this to the type of system or file system detected.

Version 1.4.11

- Change in client/server wire-up for linux/bproc systems to avoid
  start-up problems when run under totalview.

- Minor fixes.

Version 1.4.12

- Increased MAXSOCKETS value to 8192

- Added work-around for bug during process startup on bproc when
  mpirun is started from a debugger, e.g. Totalview.

Version 1.4.13

- Modified MPI_Init() and MPI_Init_thread() into macros for workaround
  for Totalview
  
- Added check for validity of executable when running under bproc or RMS

- Fixed bug when using '-env' runtime arg

Version 1.4.14

- Fixes to read STDIN from mpirun and direct it to proccess 0 of the
  application

Version 1.4.15

- There were some problems w/ the stdin forwarding in the 1.4.14
  release. Specifically , bproc support for LSF/RSH and LSF/RSH appears
  to have been incomplete.

Version 1.4.16

- Fixed long machine names, lampi.conf file. Fixed RSH 

Version 1.4.17

- Fixed issue with processes hanging that used Pthreads. Changed
  MPI_Reduce to allow non-root proccess to provide a null receive
  buffer.

Version 1.4.18

- Cleaned header files up, fixed for ICC (intel) compiler, fixed
  memory leak, Fixed parser error, lampi.conf now allows spaces in the
  file.

========================= Minor Release 1.5 =========================

  buffering.
