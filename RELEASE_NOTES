                       Release notes for LA-MPI

                       
========================= Minor Release 1.0 =========================

Version 1.0.0

First release of LA-MPI, a portable, end-to-end,
network-fault-tolerant implementation of the MPI 1.2 standard (with
some extensions).

This version complies with the MPI 1.2 standard with the following
caveats:

- MPI_Cancel() is currently implemented as a no-op.  This is not
  fully consistent with the MPI standard.


Version 1.0.1

- Updated tagging of stdout/stderr. Now optional using "mpirun -t"
- Numerous improvements to argument handling for RMS startup.
- Updated man page.


Version 1.0.1

- More improvements to RMS startup.


========================= Minor Release 1.1 =========================

Version 1.1.1

- Early send completion for Quadrics


Version 1.1.2

- Incorporating ROMIO 1.2.4.1 into library for MPI-IO support.


Version 1.1.3

- Inter-host barrier now uses synchronous sends.


Version 1.1.4

- Optional CRC functionality added.
- BPROC scheduling updated.
- Licenses updated.


Version 1.1.5

- mpirun command line updated for runtime selection of checksum/CRC
  and acking behaviour.
- Documentation updated for new mpirun options.
- Quadrics fragment sizes increased for large messages.


Version 1.1.6

- Bug fix for running with different executables on each host.
- Bug fix to allow for long hostnames.


Version 1.1.7

- Bug fixes for hybrid allgatherv, gatherv and scatterv algorithms.
- The BPROC job scheduler now integrated into the spawning mechanism.


Version 1.1.8

- Build system changed to allow for explicit rpath in libmpi.so
- Fixes for more robust handling of stdin/stderr in.
- Bug fix for broadcast of large buffers.
- Bug fix to allow for more than 128 hosts.
- Application now runs reliably beyond MPI_Finalize()
- UDP optimizations.
- Added support for Mac OS X version 10.2.x.  The Mac version does
  require the Unix utility 'lndir'.  This program is part of the
  freely available X11 distribution.  X11 is available from Apple at
  http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11 or at http://www.xfree86.org/.
- The Mac version does not support the #pragma weak directive, so for
  this release, we are renaming all PMPI_* functions to MPI_*.
  
This version has been tested on ~1000 node (~4000 processor) 
Compaq Alpha ES45 / Quadrics elan 3 system.


Version 1.1.9

- Datatype initialization reorganized.  Fortran datatypes (MPI_REAL,
  etc.) are now associated with C-linkage symbols to cater for legacy
  codes written to MPICH rather than MPI standard.
- Fortran to C handle conversion is now faster.


Version 1.1.10

- Improvements in thread-safety for the UDP path.


Version 1.1.11

- Fixed out-of-order receive problem induced by mixed wild- and
  specific-source receives.
- Changes to Quadrics rail processing.


Version 1.1.12

- Optimizations for Quadrics elan3/elite3 networks.  In particular,
  remote memory buffers management on multi-rail systems is now
  handled better allowing for higher and more consistent bandwidth
  utilization.
- Support for system-wide configuration file allowing better control
  of default behavior (especially on large systems with unusual
  configurations.


========================= Minor Release 1.2 =========================

Version 1.2.0

- Myrinet GM Port.
- Extensive reorganization of source directory structure and naming.
- Some more thread-safety problems addressed.


Version 1.2.1

- Fixing a couple of UDP bugs
- Correcting parsing of configuration files

========================= Minor Release 1.3 =========================

Version 1.3.0

- Reorganized shared memory path
- Simplified model for send/recv descriptors and requests
- Reworked buffered and persisitent send logic
- Data types are now statically allocated (but not initialized) so
  that they can be referenced before MPI_Init()
- Behavior of basic but non-primitive data types wrt MPI_Get_elements()
  modified
- MPI-IO fortran bindings improved
- Build system now based on autoconf

Version 1.3.1

- Primarily an administrative release to coincide with release as a
  module on LANL ICN machines.
- Fixed bug with persistent buffered sends.
- Faster exit on early error under RMS.

Version 1.3.2

- Changed mpirun so that if RMS or BJS are present then LSF is not.
  Consulting competing schedulers only leads to tears and confusion.
- ROMIO configuration was not working properly on Tru64 systems, and
  also was defaulting to NFS.  Now we enable and try UFS support.
- Always give Totalview a list of hostnames, not host IP addresses.
  This works around problems starting tvdsvr in bulk mode.

Version 1.3.3

- Reworked datatype freeing. The decision to free resources is now
  based upon a reference count model rather than the simple check for
  pending messages.
- Minor fixes for BJS and ROMIO.
- Some code rationalization.


Version 1.3.4

- Minor fixes for resource cleanup at finalize.
- Support for newer BPROC releases.

Version 1.3.5

- Removed memory leak associated with datatypes.
- Fortran layer can be disabled by setting environment variable LAMPI_FORTRAN=0
- Locking in the MPI layer simplified introduction of a few macros.
- Fixes for the ever-evolving BPROC release.

- Fixed bug when using '-env' runtime arg

Version 1.4.14

- Fixes to read STDIN from mpirun and direct it to proccess 0 of the
  application

Version 1.4.15

- There were some problems w/ the stdin forwarding in the 1.4.14
  release. Specifically , bproc support for LSF/RSH and LSF/RSH appears
  to have been incomplete.

Version 1.4.16

- Fixed long machine names, lampi.conf file. Fixed RSH 

Version 1.4.17

- Fixed issue with processes hanging that used Pthreads. Changed
  MPI_Reduce to allow non-root proccess to provide a null receive
  buffer.

Version 1.4.18

- Cleaned header files up, fixed for ICC (intel) compiler, fixed
  memory leak, Fixed parser error, lampi.conf now allows spaces in the
  file.

========================= Minor Release 1.5 =========================

Version 1.5.0

- InfiniBand support.

- Standard I/O uses pseudo-terminals for output to avoid runtime
  buffering.

- Thread safety improved.

Version 1.5.1

- Fixes for shared memory (/dev/zero) allocations, and various file
  descriptors problems with LSF and Bproc.

- More pty changes.

- Added -local option to mpirun.

- Improved error messages

Version 1.5.2

- More file descriptor fixes.

- Pipe to daemon children added for better detection the all-exited
  condition.

- Fall back to pipe() for stdio redirection if openpty() fails.

- Introduced TotalView debug gate reference in a separate file
  installed to $(MPI_ROOT)/lib/debug_gate.o.  Users of the latest
  TotalView on lightning (and similar systems??)  should link this
  object file with their application to ensure that TotalView can find
  the MPIR_debug_gate symbol.

- Fixed ia64 atomic operation support.

- Only use ptys for standard I/O if mpirun is attached to a tty.

Version 1.5.3

- On abnormal terminations, Kill running jobs with a kill -9 if we can.

- More data output for debugging problems.

Version 1.5.4

- Simplified start-up for more robust abnormal termination.

- Verbose option for debugging start-up.

- stdio streams explicitly set to no buffering.

- Flow control for stdin to prevent daemon 0 blocking and timing out
  on its heartbeat.

- Null objects (MPI_DATATYPE_NULL, MPI_OP_NULL, MPI_NULL_REQUEST)
  redefined to be real memory locations.

Version 1.5.5

- Updated ROMIO PANFS support.

- Added MPIR_Status_set_bytes for correct MPI-IO statuses.

- Ensure that SA_RESTART flag is set so that ROMIO operations do not
  get interrupted by unexpected signals.

Version 1.5.6

- More fixes related to MPI_NULL_REQUEST in fortran.

- Retransmission and exhaustion issues in Myrinet GM path fixed.

Version 1.5.7

- Fixed memory leak in MPI_Reduce for large buffers.

- Added version compatibility checking.

- Added optional syslog option (currently hardwired for LANL customers).

- Added resource usage collection on daemon-based platforms.

- Added command line option to specify connect timeout.

Version 1.5.8

- Heartbeat timeout increased to 30 seconds by default, and tuneable
  using -heartbeat-period and -heartbeat-timeout command line options.
  Turn heartbeat off with -heartbeat-period 0.

- Updated command-line argument processing to handle aliases for the
  same option and to allow for options starting with double-dashes
  (--np etc.).

- Updated "mpirun -help" output.

- Updated manual page.

- Updated verbose output.

Version 1.5.9

- Loss of daemon process is now detected by the administrative socket
  being closed at the remote end.

- On BPROC systems, loss of daemon process is detected by waitpid()

- Lost heartbeats no longer cause job termination.

- For Myrinet/GM, sends that fail with GM_SEND_TIMED_OUT are now
  retried.

- mpirun and libmpi now no longer use threads internally.  This should
  make the system more robust in Linux environments where there are
  several versions of pthreads currently in use.  This may cause
  problems for Tru64 platforms with very large numbers of processes.

- Totalview now works reliably on BPROC systems.

- Totalview can now correctly attach to a running job, and there is no
  problem of being killed by lost heartbeats.

- Job termination after error or MPI_Abort is now slightly less
  aggressive in order to give more opportunity for standard output and
  standard error to be recovered.

Version 1.5.10

- Improved standard I/O collection on abnormal termination.

- Fixed issue in fortran version of MPI_Wait().

Version 1.5.11

- The daemon now reaps exited children even if someone else hijacks
  SIGCHLD (thanks to Chip Kent).

- Added MPI_Get_address and MPI_Type_create_* for mimimal MPI-2
  compatibility.

- Added atexit() handler to flush standard I/O streams if the program
  exits without MPI_Abort() or MPI_Finalize().

- Improved standard I/O flushing after MPI_Abort().

- MPI_Cancel() now prints a one time warning that it is implemented as
  a no-op.

- ROMIO zero-length I/O fixes from Steve Hodson included.

- Fix for MPI_Get_elements with recursively defined types as pointed
  out by David Gunter.

- Niceties for Mac OS X shared libraries (thanks to Pascal Thibaudeau).

- Added roll-your-own fortran90 module (mpi.f90) for "use mpi".
  
Version 1.5.12

- Work around for ADIO_Resize which can cause poor MPI-IO performance if
  if a file is truncated.

Version 1.5.13

- New version of ROMIO with updated Panasas support.

- CRC bug fix for Myrinet/GM.

  messages (inluding a patch from Linux Networx).

- Optimized MPI_Type_hindexed() for MPI_BYTE to improve data
  aggregation in ROMIO.

- Optional processor affinity via "setenv LAMPI_PROCESSOR_AFFINITY 1"
  (experimental).

- Reworked error status and signal handling to be consistent with RMS
  prun. Documentation updated to reflect this change.

- On BProc, number of processes now defaults to the number of
  processors in the allocation (deduced via the NODES environment
  variable). Documentation updated to reflect this change.

Version 1.5.14

- Added more robustness to Myrinet GM support: (a) Misdelivered
  fragments are discarded; (b) Rendezvous protocol adopted for first
  fragment to avoid overloading destination with retransmits in a
  sporadically communicating application; (c) Patch from Myricom for
  correct handling of GM send timeouts.

- Change to correctly obtain the effective number of processors in an
  LSF/BJS allocation on Bproc, even for dual core processors.

- Numerous changes to error reporting.

Version 1.5.15

  MPI_ANY_SOURCE in MPI_Probe().  [rc1]

- Handle error conditions in gm_send_with_callback() for fragment
  acknowledgements. [rc2]
