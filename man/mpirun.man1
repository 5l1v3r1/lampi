.SH DESCRIPTION

mpirun
starts an MPI application compiled and linked against the 
LA\-MPI implementation of MPI. 
.PP
LA\-MPI is a network\-fault\-tolerant message\-passing system designed for 
the challenges of the terascale cluster environment. 
.PP
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB\-n\fP|\fB\-np\fP \fI number of processes\fP
 A single value 
specifies the total number of processes, while a comma\-delimited 
list of numbers specifies the number of processes on each host or 
machine. 
.TP
\fB\-N\fP\fI number of hosts\fP
 The number of hosts to use. 
.TP
\fB\-H\fP\fI hostlist\fP
 A comma\-delimited list of name(s) of 
hosts to use. 
.TP
\fB\-threads\fP
 Turn on thread safe code. 
.TP
\fB\-t\fP
 Turn on tagging of standard output and error lines 
with either GR[HR.LR.HN] (GR = global rank, HR = host rank, LR = 
local rank, HN = host name), or simply HR (on RMS/prun systems). 
.TP
\fB\-dev\fP\fI netpaths\fP
 A colon\-delimited list of one or more 
network paths to use for this MPI job. Currently the choices are 
some combination of \fItcp\fP
(TCP/IP), \fIudp\fP
(UDP/IP), \fIgm\fP
(Myrinet/GM), \fIquadrics\fP
(QsNet/Elan3) and \fIib\fP
(InfiniBand), 
depending on your installation. 
.TP
\fB\-crc\fP
 Use 32\-bit CRCs instead of 32\-bit additive checksums 
(the LA\-MPI default) for application to application data integrity 
where applicable. 
.TP
\fB\-qf,\-mf,\-ib\fP\fI flaglist\fP
 A comma\-delimited list of 
keywords that affect operation on, respectively Quadrics, 
Myrinet(GM) and InfiniBand networks. The keywords that are supported 
are "noack", "ack", "nochecksum", and "checksum". "noack" disables 
retransmission of data, but allows data sends to complete upon local 
notification by the network adapter. "nochecksum" disables 
all LA\-MPI CRC/checksum generation and verification; in this mode, 
data integrity guarantees are provided only at the network adapter 
level. The defaults are "ack", and "checksum" for a LA\-MPI library 
built with reliability mode enabled. 
.PP
For a complete list of options available with your installation, type 
mpirun \-help\&.
.PP
.SH ARGUMENTS

The \fIexecutable\fP
must be either a single executable or a 
comma\-delimited list of executables for each host or machine (which is 
not supported for all environments). Executable arguments apply to all 
specified executables. 
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES

.TP
1. mpirun prog args
 On systems where LSF, this 
command can be used to start prog args
on some number of 
hosts and processors preassigned by LSF. Note: In some 
installations LA\-MPI does not interact directly with LSF, so that a 
\-np NPROCS
option may be required. 
.TP
2. mpirun \-n 64 prog args
 On systems with LSF, this 
command will start 64 processes of prog args
on either all 
or some subset of preassigned hosts and processors. If it is a 
subset, then mpirun attempts to use all of the preassigned 
processors on a host before allocating from the next reserved host\&'s 
allocation. On systems with rsh spawning only, this command will 
start 64 processes on the local host or machine. 
.TP
3. mpirun \-n 64 \-N 40 prog args
 On systems with 
standard LSF, this command will start 64 processes on 40 preassigned 
hosts as explained in example #2. On systems with LSF/RMS, mpirun 
will start 64 processes on 40 hosts using \fIprun\fP(1)
in a block 
assignment mode. This command will not work on systems with rsh 
spawning only, as there is no specific host information available. 
.TP
4. mpirun \-n 66 \-H n1,n2,n3,n4 prog args
 This 
command will start 66 processes on the 4 named hosts. If the system 
supports LSF, then the assignment will be made using the processors 
available on each host. If the system only support rsh spawning, 
then mpirun will assign as close as possible the same number of 
processes per host (in this example, 17 processes will be started on 
n1 and n2, and 16 on n3 and n4). 
.TP
5. mpirun \-dev tcp \-t \-np 2,10,30,22 \-h n1,n2,n3,n4 prog args
 On systems with rsh spawning, this command will 
start 2 processes on n1, 10 on n2, 30 on n3, and 22 on n4. Prefix 
tagging of standard output and standard error will be done, and only 
TCP/IP will be used for intercommunication between hosts (if 
available). 
.PP
.SH FILES

.TP
mpirun
 Job spawner using LA\-MPI. 
.TP
libmpi.so
 LA\-MPI shared\-object library. 
.TP
mpi.h
 LA\-MPI main C header file. 
.TP
mpif.h
 LA\-MPI main Fortran header file. 
.TP
$MPI_ROOT/lampi.conf
 System LA\-MPI configuration file. 
.TP
$HOME/.lampi.conf
 User LA\-MPI configuration file. 
.PP
Instead of using command\-line options to mpirun, administrators and 
users can also set the default behavior of mpirun
by defining 
variables in the system and user configuration files, 
$MPI_ROOT/lampi.conf
and $HOME/.lampi.conf
file. 
.PP
For example, the configuration file 
.PP
.Vb
Quiet 1
OutputPrefix 1
MyrinetFlags noack,nochecksum
.Ve
.PP
is equivalent to setting mpirun \-q \-t \-mf noack,nochecksum\&.
.PP
The list of available configuration file variables can be 
obtained from mpirun \-help\&.
.PP
.SH DIAGNOSTICS

.PP
On error, LA\-MPI attempts to provide detailed diagnostic messages 
which are written both to standard error and the file lampi.log
in the application\&'s working directory. Occasionally, if a job dies 
unexpectedly, diagnostic error messages may not be delivered to 
stderr, but are likely to be successfully written to lampi.log\&.
.PP
Additional warning messages can be enabled with mpirun \-w\&.
Extremely verbose runtime information can be generated with 
mpirun \-verbose,
which should generally be avoided, but may be 
useful for checking the sanity of an installation. 
.PP
On systems that support job spawning via rsh
or ssh,
make sure that your shell startup environment (e.g., \&.cshrc, \&.bashrc 
etc.) correctly set the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment 
variables. 
.PP
.SH FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

The LA\-MPI project has now merged with Open MPI 
(\fBhttp://www.open\-mpi.org\fP).
The first release of Open MPI is 
scheduled for mid 2005. 
.PP
LA\-MPI will continue to be maintained until Open MPI has sufficiently 
matured for production use on terascale platforms.
