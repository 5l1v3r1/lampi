LA-MPI: The Los Alamos Message Passing Interface
</h1>
LA-MPI is a high-performance, network-fault-tolerant implementation of
MPI developed by CCS-1 with the specific goal of supporting LANL's
institutional needs.
<p>
Specifially it is designed to offer high performance on terascale
clusters that are inherently unreliable due to their very large number
of system components and to trade-offs between cost and performance.
<p>
LA-MPI offers the following features:
<ul>
<li>high performance</li>
<li>network fault tolerance (end-to-end data integrity)</li>
<li>thread safe</li>
<li>open source (LGPL license)</li>
<li>highly portable</li>
</ul>
<p>
LA-MPI is currently available as a module on LANL's Q systems.  It can
be used as a drop-in replacement for the vendor-supplied MPI
libraries, with the following caveats:
<ul>
<li>
LA-MPI uses its own <tt>mpirun</tt> program to start-up parallel jobs
and not the system <tt>prun</tt> program.
</li>
<li>
Applications must be recompiled using the MPI include files and
libraries from the LA-MPI modules.
</li>
<li>
C++ applications using the HP C++ complier should use the
<b>-model ansi</b> option
</li>
</ul>
See the <a href="lampi_man.html">man page</a> for more information.
<p>
LA-MPI is also available for Linux (IA32, IA64, AMD64 and Alpha) clusters,
with a variety of networks (Ethernet, Quadrics, Myrinet).
<h2>
Background
</h2>
LA-MPI is an implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI)
motivated by a growing need for fault tolerance at the software level
in large high-performance computing (HPC) systems.
<p>
This need is caused by the sheer number of components present in
modern HPC systems, particularly clusters.  The individual components
-- processors, memory modules, network interface cards (NICs), etc. --
are typically manufactured to tolerances adequate for small or desktop
systems.  When aggregated into a large HPC system, however,
system-wide error rates may be too great to successfully complete a
long application run. For example, a network device may have an error
rate which is perfectly acceptable for a desktop system, but not in a
cluster of thousands of nodes, which must run error free for many
hours or even days to complete a scientific calculation.
<p>
LA-MPI has two primary goals: <b>network fault tolerance</b> and
<b>high performance</b>.  Fortunately these goals are partially
complimentary, since the flexible approach we take to the use of
redundant network data paths to support fault tolerance also allows
LA-MPI to exploit all the available network bandwidth in a
network-device-rich system by sending different messages and/or
message-fragments over multiple network paths.
<p>
Other important features of LA-MPI include an open source license,
standards compliance (MPI version 1.2 integrated with ROMIO, thread
safety, and portability to many operating systems, processor
architectures and network devices.
