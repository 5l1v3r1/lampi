        Some hints for building rpms when you are *NOT* root.

1. Create a directory to serve as your work area

mkdir rpm

2. Set up a .rpmmacros file

cat .rpmmacros 
%_topdir        /home/ddd/rpm
%_dbpath        /home/ddd/rpm/var/lib/rpm

3. Initialize your own rpm database (so you can test installation)

rpm --initdb --dbpath=$HOME/rpm/var/lib/rpm

4. To build a package, lampi-1.4.1 say, put a tar file for it into the
   SOURCES directory:

        cp lampi.tar.gz /home/ddd/rpm/var/SOURCES

5. Build the SRPM from the SPEC file

        rpmbuild -bs lampi.spec

6. Build the RPMs from the SRPM
        
        rpmbuild --rebuild \
                 -with bproc -without udp -with gm -with tcp \
                 -with romio \
                 rpm/SRPMS/lampi-1.4.1-1.src.rpm


7. To test installation

        rpm --nodeps \
            --relocate /usr=/home/ddd/rpm/usr \
            -Uvh \
            rpm/RPMS/i386/lampi-1.4.1-1.i386.rpm

   Then look in rpm/usr rpm/etc to see if the tree is correct.

   Note that the ClusterMatic /etc/clustermatic files will fail with
   the current spec file.
