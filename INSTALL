BUILDING LA-MPI: The Los Alamos Message Passing Interface
---------------------------------------------------------

The GNU make utility (gmake) must be available.

The  ULM library build tries to guess the configuration of the system
using the script "src/conf/gnu-os".  It uses the string output by this
script to select a make configuration file from those available in
"src/conf".  To override the guess, set the make macro CONFIG. For
example:
        
        make CONFIG=alphaev6-dec-osf5.1-gcc

If you need to store an explicit dynamic loader directory path to find C and
C++ libraries for any shared libraries that are built, then include a
colon-delimited list of directories by invoking make with

        make rpath=directory_1:directory_2

The top level makefile has the following major targets:  build debug 
clean distclean.

  build

    makes a symbolic link shadow tree in build-$(CONFIG) and builds
    the optimized library there

    The executable mpirun and the associated library objects are
    placed in a directory directly under lampi/.  The directory is named
    after the target hence, using the above example, mpirun and the
    libraries would reside in

      lampi/build-alphaev6-dec-osf5.1-gcc/

    after a successful "make build".

  debug

     makes a symbolic link shadow tree in debug-$(CONFIG) and builds
     the debug library there

  lampi

     like build, but no ROMIO code is compiled.

  lampi-debug

     like debug, but no ROMIO code is compiled.

  clean

     removes object and dependency files

  distclean

     removes the shadow directories

  install

     builds and then installs the necessary executable, library and
     include files to a target directory which can be specified using
     the prefix variable
        make prefix=<DIR> install

  debug-install

     does a debug build and then installs the necessary executable,
     library and include files to a target directory which can be
     specified using the prefix variable

        make prefix=<DIR> debug-install
