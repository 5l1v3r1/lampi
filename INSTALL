BUILDING LA-MPI: The Los Alamos Message Passing Interface
---------------------------------------------------------

LA-MPI uses an autoconf-generated configure script and GNU make.

The typical build procedure is

  cd lampi
  configure [OPTIONS]*
  make
  make install

or, to build in a separate build directory

  mkdir builddir
  cd builddir
  $PATH_TO_SRC_DIR/configure [OPTIONS]*
  make
  make install

Type "configure --help" for various options, and see
configure.examples for some example configure lines.

LA-MPI is distributed with the ROMIO library for MPI-IO support.
By default this is not included in the build.  To do this

  configure --with-romio F90=[NAME OF F90 COMPILER]
