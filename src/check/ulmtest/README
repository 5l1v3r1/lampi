	   ulmtest -- front-end to API-level tests for ULM

ulmtest provides a common interface for a variety of tests to exercise
various aspects of ULM.

This code is intended as an API level test only.  To this end they are
written in Standard C and use only the interface to ULM advertised in
ULM.h and ULMExt.h.

Adding a new test:

The various tests are accessed via a dispatch table.  To add a new
test:

1. create a file test_???.c containing a function
   "int test_???(status_t *)" to implement the test
2. add a prototype to ulmtest.h,
3. add the new test_???.c file to SRC in the Makefile.
4. add an entry to the dispatch table "test_table" in ulmtest.c

Where possible, make use of the existing state variables (state_t),
so that the interface can be reused.
