The preferred way for Fortran 90/95 applications to declare MPI
functions is through an MPI module, mpi.mod, accessed through a 
"USE MPI" statement rather than "include 'mpif.h'".

The LA-MPI distribution does not provide a pre-compiled Fortran 90/95
module since it ties us to a specific Fortran compiler, but
application developers can generate a basic one by compiling the file
mpi.f90 in this directory.

This also provides a portable way to "USE MPI" for all MPI
implementations.

Actions:

1) f77 -c -I$MPI_ROOT/include mpi.f90

2) Edit .f90 files:

   include 'mpif.h' --> use mpi
