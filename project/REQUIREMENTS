                        LA-MPI Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             -- Draft --

Provide a message-passing library for high-performance scientific
applications which:

1. Implements the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard version 1.2
   as defined in

     http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-20-html/mpi2-report.html

   Compliance with this standard must be verified using the Intel MPI
   Test suite.

2. Guarantees the end-to-end integrity of delivered data.

3. Is portable to all systems of interest to ASCI, except where
   required proprietary information is unavailable.

4. Provides performance comparable to or better than alternative MPI
   implementations.


In future LA-MPI may be required to

1. Implement all or part of the MPI standard version 2.

2. Implement process fault tolerance.
