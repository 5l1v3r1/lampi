                       LA-MPI Coding Standards
------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             -- Draft --

The coding standards for LA-MPI development are based on a loose
interpretation of the GNU Coding Standards,

    http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html

with the following exceptions and additions:

1. K&R or BSD indentation styles are preferred to GNU indentation style,
   with 4 spaces as the unit of indentation.

2. Spaces are preferred to tabs for indentation, since tabs are
   visually represented differently by different editors.

3. For historical reasons, the core of LA-MPI is written in C++.  To
   enhance portability, avoid using advanced C++ features such as
   exceptions, deep templates, multiple inheritance.

4. For memory management, use wrapper functions ulm_malloc(), ulm_new().

5. For error reporting, use ulm_err() and its relatives.

etc.
